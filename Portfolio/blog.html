                    Gandhi, often referred to as Mahatma Gandhi or simply "Bapu," was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial
                    nationalist, and political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful
                    struggle for India's independence from British rule, and in turn inspired movements for civil rights
                    and freedom across the world. Gandhi's works, teachings, and words have inspired freedom fighters
                    and civil rights activists around the globe.
                </p>
                <p>


                    Gandhi was born on 2 October 1869 as Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi in Porbandar, a coastal town in
                    Kathiawar (now Gujarat) in India. He was from a religious Hindu family and his father, Karamchand
                    Gandhi, was a civil servant. He was an average student and later studied law in London.
